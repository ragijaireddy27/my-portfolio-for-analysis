SQL (MySQL) Approach:
1. Data Cleaning:
Are there any missing values in critical columns such as InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, Price, CustomerID?

Answer: Check for NULL values or blanks in essential columns using IS NULL and TRIM() functions. Decide whether to drop rows with missing values or impute with meaningful placeholders if appropriate.
How do we handle missing or invalid Quantity and Price values?

Answer: For Quantity, negative values may indicate errors in data, and you may need to filter them out. For Price, zero or negative values are invalid, and you should exclude or correct them.
Are there any missing values in categorical columns like Description, CustomerID, or Country?

Answer: You can replace missing values in categorical columns with "Unknown" or drop rows with missing values if they are small in number.
Are there any duplicate records in the dataset? How can we identify and remove them?

Answer: Identify duplicates by checking for repeated entries based on InvoiceNo and StockCode. Remove duplicates using DISTINCT or DELETE based on specific conditions.
Are there any outliers or invalid values in the Quantity (e.g., huge numbers or negative values) or Price?

Answer: Check for extreme outliers using the WHERE clause for values greater than a reasonable threshold (e.g., negative Quantity or Price < 0). Remove or replace outliers accordingly.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
What is the total number of transactions and total sales in the dataset?

Answer: Use SUM(Quantity * Price) to calculate total sales and COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNo) to count the number of unique transactions.
What is the overall distribution of sales by country?

Answer: Use GROUP BY Country to aggregate sales by country and check the distribution.
What is the breakdown of sales by product (StockCode/Description)?

Answer: Use GROUP BY StockCode or Description to calculate total sales for each product.
How do sales trends vary by month or year?

Answer: Use DATE_FORMAT(InvoiceDate, '%Y-%m') to extract the month and year, then aggregate sales and visualize trends over time.
What is the average transaction value (e.g., total sales per invoice)?

Answer: Calculate the total sales for each InvoiceNo and find the average sales per transaction using AVG().
How do sales break down by customer segment (e.g., by Country or CustomerID)?

Answer: Aggregate data by CustomerID or Country and calculate total sales to understand the sales distribution across different customer segments.
Which products have the highest and lowest sales?

Answer: Use GROUP BY StockCode and aggregate by SUM(Quantity * Price) to determine top and bottom-selling products.
3. Aggregation & Insights:
What are the top 10 best-selling products based on total sales?

Answer: Sort by the total sales (SUM(Quantity * Price)) and limit the results to the top 10 products using ORDER BY and LIMIT.
How do sales compare across different customer segments or countries?

Answer: Use GROUP BY Country or CustomerID and aggregate sales. Visualize the differences across segments using bar charts.
What are the total sales and transactions for each month/year?

Answer: Use DATE_FORMAT(InvoiceDate, '%Y-%m') to group by month and calculate total sales per period.
Which customers are the highest spenders (by total sales)?

Answer: Aggregate sales by CustomerID and sort to find the customers with the highest spending.
What is the sales distribution across different product categories (if available)?

Answer: If product categories are provided in the data (e.g., grouped by product type), GROUP BY the category and summarize sales.
How does sales volume change based on different product prices or quantities?

Answer: Aggregate sales based on Price and Quantity to analyze how volume changes with price/quantity adjustments.
4. Visualizing Results:
How can we visualize sales trends over time (e.g., monthly, yearly)?

Answer: Use SQL to aggregate sales by month or year, then export the data to a visualization tool (e.g., Python, Excel) for plotting line charts.
What is the total sales volume by product (StockCode/Description)?

Answer: Use GROUP BY StockCode to calculate total sales by product, and visualize the data with bar charts or pie charts.
How can we visualize sales by country or customer segment?

Answer: Use GROUP BY Country or CustomerID to aggregate total sales, and visualize this with bar charts or pie charts.
What is the relationship between Quantity and Price?

Answer: Visualize Quantity vs. Price using scatter plots to identify patterns or correlations.
Python Approach (Data Cleaning, EDA, Analysis, and Visualization):
1. Data Cleaning:
Are there any missing or null values in columns such as InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, Price, CustomerID?

Answer: Check for NaN values using df.isnull().sum(). If critical columns have missing data, either impute (e.g., placeholder or mean/median) or drop rows with missing values.
How do we handle missing or invalid Quantity and Price values?

Answer: For Quantity, filter out negative values (e.g., df[df['Quantity'] > 0]). For Price, drop rows with non-positive values using df[df['Price'] > 0].
Are there any duplicate rows?

Answer: Identify duplicates with df.duplicated(). Remove them with df.drop_duplicates().
Are there any outliers in Quantity or Price?

Answer: Detect outliers using box plots or the IQR method. You can remove or cap outliers based on the dataset distribution.
Are there unrealistic values (e.g., negative Quantity or Price)?

Answer: Filter out rows with negative Quantity or Price using conditions like df[df['Quantity'] >= 0] and df[df['Price'] > 0].
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
What is the total sales volume across all transactions?

Answer: Calculate total sales as df['Quantity'] * df['Price'] and sum the result to get the total sales volume.
How does sales break down by country or customer segment?

Answer: Group by Country or CustomerID and use df.groupby('Country')['Sales'].sum() to calculate the total sales per segment.
What is the overall distribution of sales by month, year, or product?

Answer: Extract month and year using df['InvoiceDate'].dt.month and df['InvoiceDate'].dt.year, then group by these features and visualize trends.
Which products have the highest and lowest sales?

Answer: Group by StockCode or Description, sum sales, and sort to find top-selling and least-selling products.
How do sales compare by product categories?

Answer: If category information is available, group by category and calculate the total sales. Visualize using bar charts.
What is the average transaction value (e.g., total sales per invoice)?

Answer: Group by InvoiceNo to calculate the total sales per transaction and then find the average using mean().
3. Feature Engineering:
Can we create new time-based features (Month, Year) from InvoiceDate?

Answer: Use df['InvoiceDate'].dt.month and df['InvoiceDate'].dt.year to create new time-based features.
Can we categorize products into different price bands (e.g., low, medium, high)?

Answer: Use pd.cut() to segment products into price ranges, then analyze how sales change across these segments.
Can we combine StockCode and Description into a single feature for more detailed analysis?

Answer: Create a new column by combining StockCode and Description (e.g., df['Product'] = df['StockCode'] + " - " + df['Description']).
4. Visualization:
How can we visualize sales trends over time?

Answer: Use matplotlib or seaborn to plot time series data (monthly or yearly) for sales trends with line or bar charts.
What is the total sales volume per product?

Answer: Aggregate sales by StockCode and visualize the result with bar charts or pie charts.
How can we visualize the relationship between Quantity and Price?

Answer: Use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between Quantity and Price.
How does the sales distribution differ between product categories?

Answer: If product categories are available, visualize them with a pie chart or stacked bar chart to compare sales across categories.
Analysis:
1. Overall Sales Growth:
How have sales evolved over time?
Analyze trends over the years/months. Is there an overall increase or decline in sales?
2. Top-Selling Products:
What are the top 5 or 10 best-selling products by total sales?
Identify top products based on sales volume and categorize them accordingly.
3. Regional Sales Patterns:
How does sales vary by country?
Group by Country and calculate total sales to identify regional trends.
