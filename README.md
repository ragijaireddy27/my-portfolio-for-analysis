# Online Retailer Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository showcases various projects that I've worked on related to the **Online Retailer Dataset**. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations, which are all performed using **Python** and its associated libraries. This project aims to demonstrate the complete workflow of analyzing an e-commerce dataset to extract valuable insights for business decision-making.

## Project Overview

The project consists of three key parts:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - In this section, we explore the dataset by understanding the structure, handling missing data, and identifying trends.
   - **File**: `Exploratory_Data_Analysis_on_online_retailer.ipynb`

2. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - This section deals with cleaning the data, such as handling null values, converting data types, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
   - **File**: `Data_cleaning_on_online_retailer.ipynb`

3. **Data Visualizations**: 
   - This section includes visualizations to uncover insights like sales trends, top-selling products, regional performance, and customer segmentation.
   - **File**: `visualizations_on_online_retailer.ipynb`

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis includes transactional data from an online retailer, which contains the following columns:

- **InvoiceNo**: Unique transaction number.
- **StockCode**: Product identifier.
- **Description**: Description of the product.
- **Quantity**: Number of items purchased.
- **InvoiceDate**: Date and time of the transaction.
- **UnitPrice**: Price of each unit.
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Country**: Country of the customer.
  
The dataset is provided in a `.zip` file that contains the CSV format data.

- **File**: `online_retailer.zip` (CSV file in ZIP format)

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for running the code
- **CSV** format for dataset storage
- **Power BI / Excel** (optional for additional analysis outside the notebook)
