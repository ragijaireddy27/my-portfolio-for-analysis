# Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! This repository showcases various projects Iâ€™ve worked on, analyzing datasets such as **Titanic**, **Car Sales**, and **Online Retailer**. The analysis includes **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **visualizations** using tools like **Python**, **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset**
- In this section, I explore the Titanic dataset, focusing on survival analysis, passenger demographics, and patterns that influence survival chances.

### 2. **Car Sales Analysis**
- This analysis explores car sales data, looking at sales performance, customer demographics, and product trends.
- **File**: `Exploratory_Data_Analysis_on_car_sales.ipynb`

### 3. **Online Retailer Data Analysis**
- Here, I analyze e-commerce transaction data, focusing on sales trends, customer segmentation, and regional performance.

## Dataset

The datasets used in this project are:

1. **Titanic Dataset**: A dataset containing information about passengers, including whether they survived or not.
2. **Car Sales Dataset**: Data related to car sales, including information about car models, customers, and sales transactions.
3. **Online Retailer Dataset**: A transactional dataset from an online retailer, including product information, quantities, prices, and customer data.

The dataset files are provided in CSV format and can be found in the respective ZIP files or data directories.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** (MySQL for data cleaning and analysis)
- **Excel/Power BI** (optional for additional analysis and reporting)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for running the analysis and visualizations
- **CSV format** for dataset storage

## Workflow

Each section in this repository includes a step-by-step analysis workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Preparing the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring the data to uncover insights, patterns, and relationships.
3. **Visualizations**: Presenting key findings through graphs and charts to visualize trends and data insights.
